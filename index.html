			<p>Put 'em up now
             Yeah
             This is not the end, this is not the beginning<br>
             Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision<br>
             Won't you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm<br>
             And though the words sound steady<br>
             Something empty's within 'em<br>
             We say, "Yeah"<br>
             With fists flying up in the air<br>
             Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there<br>
            'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
            Until<br>
            Waiting for the end to come<br>
            Wishing I had strength to stand<br>
            This is not what I had planned<br>
            It's out of my control<br>           
            Flying at the speed of light<br>
            Thoughts were spinning in my head<br>
            So many things were left unsaid<br>
            It's hard to let you go<br>
            I know what it takes to move on<br>
           (Oh) I know how it feels to lie<br>
(Oh) all I wanna do is trade this life for something new<br>
Holding on to what I haven't got<br>
Sitting in an empty room<br>
Trying to forget the past<br>
This was never meant to last<br>
I wish it wasn't so<br>
I know what it takes to move on<br>
(Oh) I know how it feels to lie<br>
(Oh) all I wanna do is trade this life for something new<br>
Holding on to what I haven't got (yo, yo)<br>
What was left when that fire was gone<br>
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong<br>
All caught up in the eye of the storm<br>
And tryna figure out what it's like moving on<br>
And I don't even know what kind of things I've said<br>
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead<br>
So, picking up the pieces now where to begin<br>
The hardest part of ending is starting again<br>
Oh, all I wanna do is trade this life for something new<br>
Holding on to what I haven't got<br>
This is not the end, this is not the beginning<br>
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision<br>
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm (I'm holding onto what I haven't-<br>
And though the words sound steady, something empty's within 'em (got)<br>
We say, "Yeah"<br>
With fists flying up in the air<br>
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there<br>
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and fear (holding onto what I haven't-)<br>
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear (got)</p>
